# R2D2 Modular control unit (MCU)

> [!NOTE]  
> - My MKIII R2D2 is still **work-in-progress** therefore i some changes in the design are possible!

## General motivation
- There are many good solutions for organizing all the control electronics for the whole selection of R2D2 bodys.
- However, none of these solutions fully met my requirements, so I designed my own interpretation of a modular control unit `the brain`.
  - Special thanks to everyone who inspired me, particularly John van Ohrs with his [R2D2 modular electronics panel by jfmvoers - Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6580609) and Tim Eebel with his [MarkIII Hinged Electronics Panel](https://www.printables.com/model/614178-markiii-hinged-electronics-panel).

## Requirements
- The module must be completely removable as a single unit to allow work on it at the workbench.
  - Everything must be possible without any special tools, i.e., plug-and-play instead of screws (almost achieved)!
- To allow access when installed, the entire unit must be hinged (no tools required for this step).
- The design must be modular, allowing it to be adapted to specific requirements.
- The design must be based on a grid (60x60mm) and offers panels ranging from `1x1` to `1xX`.

## Used Mods & Kudos

> [!NOTE]

- Dome Motor Mount by [Gonz Pousada J Luis](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MrBaddeley/posts/3683034678691760/).

- A special thanks to Ben from [Printed Droid](https://printed-droid.com), who provided me with the electronic components, and to Norbert A. Richartz, who is developing the AstroCan System and [BetterDuinoFirmwareV4](https://github.com/RealNobser/BetterDuinoFirmwareV4). He answered nearly all my questions and integrated some cool features.
