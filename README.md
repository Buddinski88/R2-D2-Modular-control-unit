# R2D2 Modular control unit (MCU)

> [!CAUTION]
> - My MKIII R2D2 is still **work-in-progress** therefore i some changes in the design are possible!

# General

## Description
- There are now many good solutions for organizing all the control electronics for the MKIII body.
- However, none of these solutions fully met my requirements, so I designed my own interpretation.
  - Special thanks to everyone who inspired me, particularly John van Ohrs with his [R2D2 modular electronics panel by jfmvoers - Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6580609).

## Requirements
- The module must be completely removable as a single unit to allow work on it at the workbench.
  - Everything must be possible without any special tools, i.e., plug-and-play instead of screws!
- To allow access when installed, the entire unit must be hinged (no tools required for this step).
- The design must be modular, allowing it to be adapted to specific requirements.
- The design is based on a grid (60x60mm) and offers panels ranging from `1x1` to `1xX`.
